<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  <strong>ember-concurrency</strong> is a small but powerful library that supplements
  Ember's existing tools and conventions for handling concurrency and
  asynchrony.
</p>

  For a high-level view of what ember-concurrency can do for your app,

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<p>
  <strong>ember-concurrency</strong> enables you to write <strong>Tasks</strong>, which are asynchronous,
  cancelable operations that are bound to the lifetime of the object they live on,
  which means when the host object is destroyed (e.g. a component is unrendered),
  the task is automatically canceled. Here is an example of a task:
</p>

{{intro-task}}

{{code-snippet name="intro-task.js"}}

<p>
  The example above demonstrates a few things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Tasks are implemented using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*">ES6 Generator Function syntax</a>
    and the <code>yield</code> keyword
  </li>
  <li>
    This syntax enables writing async code in a synchronous looking manner
  </li>
  <li>
    It is trivial to restart a task without having to manually cancel the previous task.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Without Tasks</h3>

<p>
  To understand everything that ember-concurrency tasks afford you, here
  is a reimplementation of the above example without using tasks:
</p>

{{intro-task-oldschool}}

{{code-snippet name="intro-task-oldschool.js"}}

<p>
  As you can see, it takes a surprising amount of code to handle
  all of the corner cases when dealing with async code:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You have to stop the currently running operation before starting a new
    operation in its place; in other words, you need to prevent accidental
    concurrency
  </li>
  <li>
    You have to stop the operation when the parent object is destroyed
  </li>
  <li>
    You have to break down each step of the asynchronous operation into
    individually cancelable units
  </li>
</ul>
