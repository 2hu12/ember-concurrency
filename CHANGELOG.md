# Changelog

### 0.5.3:
 - Added .maxConcurrency(n) task modifier which works in
   conjunction with the other task modifiers.
 - `nameOfTask.perform()` returns a Task Instance, which represents
   a single execution of that task which might be cancelled, dropped,
   or run to completion. It exposes a .cancel() method and other
   properties like .isRunning or .isFinished

### 0.5.0:
 - First stable version since re-working the docs site
 - No more reliance on js-csp, or CSP concepts whatsoever
